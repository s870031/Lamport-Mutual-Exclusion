Topic: Lamport's Mutual Exclusion

Files/Folders:
1. src/: Source code folder
         files: Project2.java, Node.java, ConfigReader.java, Message.java,
				RV.java, LamportMutEx.java, RequestComparator.java
2. bin/: Class folder
3. launcher.sh: Launch "Project2" on remote device according to config file

1. Run launcher.sh with configuration file as parameter:
        sh launcher.sh [Configuration File Name]
2. To End program, Run cleanup.sh with config file as parameter:
        sh cleanup.sh [Configuation File Name]
3. To verify the correctness of protocol, run command: python test.py

Output:
1. At the end of the program the program will generate output files named
